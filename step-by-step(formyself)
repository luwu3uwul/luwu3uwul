rnow I'm interested in coding and computer in general since I was 8 I ve been into such things but I played games and felt cool that I was able to recognise its malfunctions bugs
, weak sides, possibilities and more until now I didn't feel this much necessity and urge to learn last 2 years was empty I found a job worked for almost 8 months but then that 
pandemi and so on but I wasn't happy now this is a new start world is changing my old job wasn't that good anyways and it wasn't futuristic as well.

lets get to another subject I started reading a book about coding, Python for data analysis I have no experience never tryied anything related to codes apart from cmd and now lets
start from zero.
